Copyright (C) 2011 Igor Augusto de Faria Costa

This is Gameka, an open-source multiplatform game creator for non-programmers. It is written in C++ 
and uses frameworks like SDL/Qt. It's licensed under LGPL.

== Dependencies ==
Gameka depencies are:
 - SDL ( >= 1.2.14) (http://www.libsdl.org/)
 - SDL_image ( >= 1.2.10) (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
 - SDL_ttf ( >= 2.0) (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
 - SDL_gfx ( >= 2.0.22) (http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/content/view/19/14/)

=== Installation ==
Open the project (gameka.pro) in Qt Creator (http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools/) and
build it. It will create two binaries: 
1. gameka_windows or gameka_linux or gameka_mac (depending on your OS), which is the gameka itself.
2. runtime_linux or runtime_mac or runtime_w32 (depending on your OS), which is the runtime.

Copy the editor to the project root; and copy the runtime to data/project_data/runtime-common. Run.
